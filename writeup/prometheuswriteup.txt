Prometheus||
============
Had to find the  monitoring code in Giftcardsite/Legacysite views.py.

Looked at the assiociated libary for prometheus. Graphs.inc is being called within special keys that was writen in the views.py.

Had to remove  all the keys since it log unsafe monitoring about the content of the website like logging in, registering interacting with the cards, I feel that is unsafe to even log that publicly. 

created my graphs key database_error_return_404 and used graphs['database_error_return_404'].inc() near 404 errors to logged the error response of the website.

Installed prometheus to run in the kuberenete cluster, used the following documentation to install helm and with promoetheus.

https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/installing-prometheus

kubectl get pods , saw listed of prometheus pods running but not configured to my giftcard site.

it stated in prometheus docs that i have edit the prometheus config map.

Kubectl get configmap , finding the configuration for prometheus , which is promoetheus server.

kubectl edit configmap prometheus-server, editing prometheus...  

was using VIM, changed it to nano, alot eaiser.  

export KUBE_EDITOR="nano"

edit the configmap,

added proxy-service:8080 under the targert

save it.

configmap should save it automatically without manually enter a commands.

kubectl port-forward deployment/prometheus-pushgateway 9091, using the prometheus website which will point to the proxy-server that willpoint to the django giftcardsite app.

open firefox . get request to localhost:9090

click on metrics

and find the key that was created in view.py which was database_error_return_404

you can see database_error_return_404 value after executing button.
